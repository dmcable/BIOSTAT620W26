    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThe faculty and staff of the School of Public Health believe that the conduct of a student registered or taking courses in the School should be consistent with that of a professional person. Courtesy, honesty, and respect should be shown by students toward faculty members, guest lecturers, administrative support staff, community partners, and fellow students. Similarly, students should expect faculty to treat them fairly, showing respect for their ideas and opinions and striving to help them achieve maximum benefits from their experience in the School. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that may include plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials),and aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Please visit the University of Michigan School of Public Health Academic Policies and Processes for the full Academic Integrity policy. for the full policy.\n\nStatement on the use of Artificial Intelligence\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) may be used under the direction and rules specified by the course instructor in specific circumstances as outlined in the syllabus. The student is responsible for the quality and content of all written assignments. Unless otherwise indicated by the course instructor, generative AI may be used to create an initial literature review, document outline and/or to organize material toward a first draft of a class paper, proofreading, or grammatical accuracy; however the final content of the written document and critical thinking of the ideas presented in the document must represent the student’s individual work and ideas learned through course content and/or research conducted from sources outside of the generative AI system. The student must include an annotation on all materials submitted that explicitly documents how AI was used to generate the document and properly reference both the sources and the AI tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023). The student must review the information in the document and edit for accuracy, completeness, proper grammar, and demonstrate that the wording accurately reflects the student’s understanding and purpose in writing the text. Students should be aware that text generated solely from AI generators may include factual errors, bias, and may contain incomplete or inaccurate reference information, in addition to furthering appropriating knowledge produced by historically marginalized scholars without proper crediting. If you have any questions on whether a specific AI tool is allowed for any aspect of your work in this class, please ask your instructor for guidance. Failure to ensure agreement with your instructor on use of AI, prior to doing so, may result in a zero score. (NOTE: instructors have sophisticated tools to determine AI plagiarism.)"

SSD arranges reasonable and appropriate academic accommodations for students with disabilities. Please visit the Services for Students with Disabilities website for more information on student accommodations.\nStudents who expect to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments as a consequence of their religious observance shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete such academic responsibilities. It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent. Please visit the Office of the Provost website for the complete University policy.\nStudents who are feeling ill should not come to class in-person. Your grade will not be negatively impacted by not attending class due to illness. If you need flexibility due to being ill, having caregiving responsibilities, childcare responsibilities, etc., please email me as soon as possible so that we can come up with a plan to allow flexibility in assignment due dates."

Add your responses to your lab report, with relevant code in the associated R code chunk, and free-form text outside of the code chunk.\n\nLet’s take a look at what these datasets are. To start, we can make a frequency table of the dataset variable:\n\ntable(datasaurus_dozen$dataset)\n\nHere, we used the $ operator to access a specific column (variable) of the dataset. Then we used the table function to summarize that variable. table is great for quickly summarizing categorical variables, but it’s not very useful for summarizing continuous variables, where most unique values are only present once. For continuous variables, try the summary function.\nThe original Datasaurus (dino) was created by Alberto Cairo in a blog post. The other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice. In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of datasets with the same summary statistics as the Datasaurus, but with very different distributions."

    "text": "Question 2\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for just this dataset.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Quarto document and successfully Render it and view the results.\nWe’re going to start by subsetting our data down to just the dino dataset.\n\nSubsetting\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen[datasaurus_dozen$dataset == 'dino', ]\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nThe first thing to note is the assignment operator: &lt;-. This special symbol is used to create a new object or assign a new value to an existing one. In this case, we’re creating a new object called dino_data.\nThe second important feature is the set of square brackets: []. When these come immediately after the name of an object, they are used for subsetting that object, or taking a smaller piece of it. In this case, we want to subset the datasaurus_dozen object. Since this is a two-dimensional data.frame, we can subset it by either rows or columns, or both. The comma (,) separates our row subset from our column subset. In this case, we only want to subset by row and keep all the columns, so there is nothing after the comma.\nIn R (as in Python and many other programming languages), we can check whether or not two values are equal by using the == operator. Here, we again use the $ to access the dataset variable and we check if it is equal to the value 'dino'. If it is, this comparison will return TRUE and we will keep that row. If it isn’t, this comparison will return FALSE and we will not keep that row.\n\n\nPlotting\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the plot function for this, which is R’s most basic plotting function. If you provide the plot function with two numeric vectors, it will plot them in a scatter plot. Let’s see what happens when we plot the x and y variables from our dino_data object:\n\nplot(dino_data$x, dino_data$y)\n# ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n#   geom_point()\n\n(I’ve also included code for producing similar plots using the ggplot function from the ggplot2 package. This is another widely-used plotting function that includes some more aesthetically pleasing defaults, but requires more complicated syntax)\nWe will talk a lot more about the philosophy of data visualization, how to choose the right plot type, and constructing visualizations in layers in the coming weeks. But for now, you can follow along with the code that is provided.\nFor the second part of these exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear – it’s dinosaurial!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let’s calculate correlation coefficient between x and y. Like plot, the cor function takes two numeric variables and calculates their correlation coefficient:\n\ncor(dino_data$x, dino_data$y)\n# dino_data |&gt;\n#   summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n(I’ve also included the “tidyverse” way of calculating this value. The “tidyverse” is a collection of packages that includes ggplot2 and is based on the concept of “tidy”, rectangular datasets. We will tend to focus on the “Base R” way of doing things, as learning the “tidyverse” coding style is almost like learning another language in addition to R)"

    "text": "Question 5\nNow let’s plot all 13 datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of the layout function. This function allows you to put multiple plots in the same plotting window. We will create a 4x4 matrix containing the values 1 through 16 and pass this to layout, which lets it know where we want each plot to go (we only have 13 datasets, so there will be a few empty spots at the end). This may be too many plots for a small viewing window, so if you get the error message Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large, try making your plotting window larger.\nThen we use a for loop to perform a set of actions over every unique value of the dataset variable. This creates a new object, called name, that takes on each of those unique values, but it only exists within the context (interior) of the loop. Then we subset and plot the data, as we have before.\n\nlayout(matrix(1:16, nrow=4, ncol=4))\nfor(name in unique(datasaurus_dozen$dataset)){\n  subset &lt;- datasaurus_dozen[datasaurus_dozen$dataset == name, ]\n  plot(subset$x, subset$y, main = name)\n}\nlayout(1)\n\n\n# ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+\n#   geom_point()+\n#   facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n#   theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nThe second call to layout will reset the plotting window, so that the next plot will take up the entire window, rather than 1/16th of it.\nOptional:If you really want to maximize the plotting area of this figure, you can also adjust the plotting margins via the par function (short for “graphical parameters”). The setting for margins is called mar and it takes a vector of length 4, specifying the bottom, left, top, and right margins, in order (the units are lines of text). You can set each margin to a value of 2 with par(mar = c(2,2,2,2)) and then reset to the default values with par(mar = c(5,4,4,2) + 0.1)."

    "text": "Question 6\nFinally, we want to calculate the correlation between the x and y variables for all 13 datasets. Like before, we will use a loop, but this time, since we want to return a specific value every time through the loop, we will use the sapply function. sapply is useful way to apply a function to every element of a vector. In this case, we provide the vector of unique dataset names (like before) and then our own custom function. This function subsets the data as before, and then returns the correlation coefficient as the output of the function.\n\nsapply(unique(datasaurus_dozen$dataset), function(name){\n    subset &lt;- datasaurus_dozen[datasaurus_dozen$dataset == name, ]\n    return(cor(subset$x, subset$y))\n})\n\n\n# datasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n#   group_by(dataset) |&gt;\n#   summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\nYou’re now done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like you to do two more things:\nResize your figures:\nAdd the fields fig-width and fig-height to the YAML header of your document. These will allow you to specify the size (in inches) of any figures generated by the code chunks in your report.\nYou can also use different figure sizes for different figures. If you are in the Visual editor mode, switch to Source mode. Notice that each R chunk starts and ends with three backticks. Click on the gear icon in the top right of a code chunk and select “Use custom figure size” in the pop-up menu. Set the height and width of the figures and hit Apply when done. Then, render your document and see how you like the new sizes. Try making the plot for Question 5 larger, until you are happy with its size. Note that changing the figure sizes added new options to these chunks: fig.width and fig.height. You can change them by defining different values directly in your Quarto document as well.\nChange the look of your report:\nIf you have time, you can explore the different ways you can add styling to your document. Try adding a theme field to the YAML header and see if you can find valid names of different themes.\nHere is a Quarto cheatsheet and a general markdown cheatsheet that shows some of the many cool features you can make use of in a Quarto document."
