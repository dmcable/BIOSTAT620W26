# Course Materials for BIOSTAT 620

The BIOSTAT 620 course website is
[here](https://dmcable.github.io/BIOSTAT620W26). We will be using
this website to share all course material including lecture slides,
labs, and assignments.

Our class meets at 8:30 AM every Tuesday and Thursday.


# For instructors

Repo overview:

 - `data` contains datasets used in lecture slides.
 - `docs` is where the website is built. You shouldn't need to manually change anything here, but the website won't update unless you re-run `quarto render`, which regenerates this directory.
 - `assignments` contains homework assignments.
 - `labs` contains weekly labs.
 - `slides` contains weekly lecture slides.
 
Yearly checklist:
 - Update Home page (`index.qmd`)
 - Update Schedule page (`schedule.qmd`)
 - Update HW, Midterm, and Final due dates
 - Update the [BIOSTAT620-whoami](https://github.com/dmcable/BIOSTAT620W26-whoami) repo before Week 2
